description: 'The Vim editor is one in a handful of text editors ubiquitous in nearly all Unix systems. It is designed based off of the earlier releaed Vi text editor, and is advertised as an improved version. While an initial learning curve is present, Vim aims to be a hyper efficient text editor and provides an extensive plugin system which can be configured to user preferences, as well as support for hundreds of programming languages and file extentions. The core distribution of Vim is preloaded with powerful text manipulation capabilities which provide users with tools to address a diverse range of situations without any pre-configuration required. Much more than a simple text editor, Vim transcends its deceptively straightforward user interface and offers unlimited customization opportunities, with the potential to be transformed into a fully featured programming IDE with integrated Github support, and features rivaling the very best free and paid IDE's on the market today.
