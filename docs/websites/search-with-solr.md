## Introduction To This Tutorial

Upon completing the steps in this guide, you will have a fully installed Solr instance ready to integrate with your website, as well as performed some basic configuration.

## Before You Begin

1. Working through this tutorial requires the use of a limited user account. If you have yet to create one, follow the steps in the [Securing Your Server](/docs/security/securing-your-server) guide.

{: .note}
> Some of the commands below require elevated privilidges to execute, and must be prefixed with `sudo` when necessary.

# Install Solr

While various ways of installing Solr exist, downloading from the Apache website ensures you will receive the latest version.

## Update System And Install Pre-requisites

1. Update system packages.

    **Debian-based**

        apt update -y && apt upgrade -y

    **Fedora & RHEL based**

        yum update -y && yum upgrade -y

    **Arch linux**

        pacman -Syyu

    **OpenSuse**

        zypper dup

2. Install Java

    **Debian-based**

    1. Add the Java 8 repository, download the gpg key, and install Java 8. 

            echo "deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/webupd8team/java/ubuntu xenial main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/webupd8team-java.list

            echo "deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/webupd8team/java/ubuntu xenial main" | tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/webupd8team-java.list

            apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys EEA14886

            apt update

            apt install oracle-java8-installer 

    2. In most systems, the *oracle-java8-set-default* package will also be downloaded and installed. To verify, run the following command and check for matching output. If your output does not match, continue to step 3. Otherwise, Java 8 installation is complete.

            dpkg --list | grep oracle

    *Output*
        
        ii  oracle-java8-installer        8u144-1~webupd8~0            all          Oracle Java(TM) Development Kit (JDK) 8
        ii  oracle-java8-set-default      8u144-1~webupd8~0            all          Set Oracle JDK 8 as default Java

    3. Install the *oracle-java8-set-default* package.

        apt install oracle-java8-set-default

    **Fedora & RHEL based**

        yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk.x86_64

    **Arch linux**

        pacman -S jre8-openjdk 

    **openSUSE**

        zypper in java-1_8_0-openjdk

    Once Java is installed, verify the installation by running the following command:

        java -version

    Your output should be similar to the lines below:

    *Output*

        openjdk version "1.8.0_144"
        OpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea 3.5.1) (suse-13.3-x86_64)
        OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.144-b01, mixed mode)
